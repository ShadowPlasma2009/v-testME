## v-testME

Virginity Assessment Test™ - Male Edition

A terminal based meme quiz that asks
absurdly specific questions and roasts
you based on your answers.

Not scientifically accurate. 100% judgemental.

>This is the Male Edition of v-test.
>FE coming soon! I plan to add
>up to 256 questions to each test.
>From all available questions, the
>test asks you 20 random ones. Some
>questions don't add any points at all
>to your virginity score. Most add 1.
>Some questions might add up to 3, for now.
